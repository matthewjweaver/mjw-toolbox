# This script has two assumptions about pf rules:
#   1. There are a pair of labels on all traffic at the edge of the
#      network, named for the host and direction the traffic is
#      travelling. For example: 192.168.1.1-in and 192.168.1.1-out
#   2. The pf rules with these labels are set "no state"

# The labels each get eight per-label statistics provided via pfctl(8):
#   evaluations,
#   packets total,
#   bytes total,
#   packets in,
#   bytes in,
#   packets out,
#   bytes out,
#   state creations

# The rules do not create states, so we expect the "in" labels to only
# show packets/bytes in, and so on with the "out" rules.
# Also, State creations should always be 0.
# We create DS and RRAs for them anyway, because it's cheap and who
# knows what the future holds.
